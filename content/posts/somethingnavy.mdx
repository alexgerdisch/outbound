## Ecommerce, fashion

1. Brian Anderson, CEO (Nacelle, an agency), wanted to build an independent online store for his client.
2. This was important because Something Navy previously sold product through Nordstrom.com, but experienced several outages due to traffic spikes when new products dropped.
3. They could not rely on Nordstrom.com, or buiild a new site themselves from scratch due to limited internal dev resources. 
4. By building and hosting on Netlify, they were able to quickly ship a new site with a small team. The new site sold $1m+ in the first 30mins, with over 100k unique sessions.
