## Consumer electronics, 200 person dev team, Next.js, dynamic sites.

1. Raj Nigam, Frontend Developer, wanted to quickly build a new site for Peloton without using infra resources.
2. This was important becuase as a hyper growth startup, they needed to have a quick dev workflow, the ability to build and host reliably without any downtime, and an easy to manage stack.
3. They could not accomplish this using Cloudflare, etc because their infra stack required constant mantenence and a dedicated team. It limited the ability of their cross functional teams (marketing, content, eng, support) to get things done.
4. Now, Peloton has standardized on a jamstack architecture using Netlify. Their team of 200+ devs deploys 1300 times a day across 75 unique sites.
