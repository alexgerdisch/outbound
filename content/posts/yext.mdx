## B2B SaaS - Search, Dynamic sites

1. Liz Frailey, VP Platform, was tasked with building an enterprise LMS (learning management system) at Yext inspired by Salesforce Trailblazer. 
2. This was important becuase Yext was a growing private company that wanted to enable their customers and user base to adopt Yext more quickly and easily. 
3. They could not accomplish this with their old architecture becuase they had a short timeline and only access to one frontend dev resource on the project.
4. Netlify enabled this single developer to launch the LMS project on time before their user conference. The marketing and content teams can now make changes instantly, and have adopted Netlify for future projects like conference sites."
