## B2B SaaS - HR, localization 

1. Trevor Smith, Director of web development, was working to improve the performance of their marketing sites and unlock their marketing team to make changes quickly to the site without dev resources.
2. This was important because there were 12+ international marketing sites with cross functional teams around the world making changes and updates.
3. The existing architecture made it impossible for the team to make changes without IT resources, led to poor performing sites, and impacted their ability to hire great engineers.
4. After moving to Netlify, there are no longer any dependencies on IT or Devops to make site changes. Development tasks complete 30% faster, and page load times improved by over 25%.
