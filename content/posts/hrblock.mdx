## Financial Services, Azure

1. Hal Wong, Solutions Architect (Pixel Pusher Agency), was tasked with redesigning the marketing site for HR Block well before tax season.
2. This was important becuase Canada is a high growth region for HR Block and they wanted to improve their customer experience from previous poor reviews 
3. Previous projects built on Azure with Wordpress took too long to build and were challenging to update because HRB's content authors were locked to the dev teams release cycle.
4. Hal built the new site on Netlify that met the demands of the traffic spikes around tax season, without any resources from the HR block cloud team. The content teams could now make updates to things like promotions in minutes leading up to tax season.
