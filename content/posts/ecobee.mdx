## Consumer electronics, ecommerce, self-service upgrade (edge + build)

1. Sandra Fiske, Eng manager, wanted to migrate their tech stack to the jamstack to allow their content authors and devs to work independently and release changes more quickly.
2. This was important because their ecommerce business took off and the dev team tripled in a year
3. Their old architecture led to long build times as the team grew. 
4. After transitioning to Netlify with headless Shopify, the team has seen a dramatic decrease in build times and and are transitioning all of their web properties.
