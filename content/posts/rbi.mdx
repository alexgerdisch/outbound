## Restaurant / food industry, multiple web properties, unifying technologies

1. Teddy Sherril, CTO, wanted to move from using agency developers to an in house team with a standardized tech stack across brands and sites.
2. This was important becuase RBI planned a revamp of brands, sites, even menus that required a rapid pace of development that was not currently possible.
3. This was not possible before using agency developers who took months to deliver projects with a variety of technologies.
4. Netlify enabled RBI's lean internal dev team to have a standard tech stack across 25+ sites around the world that could handle intense traffic spikes, including one site that saw 500k users in 5 minutes on launch."
